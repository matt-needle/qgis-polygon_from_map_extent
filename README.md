# Polygon from map extent
An ultra-lightweight QGIS plugin to make a polygon from the current map extent. This is useful when you want to quickly make an area of interest from your currrent view.

A virtual layer is created using the project Coordinate Reference Sytem. The layer will persist in the project on saving and closing.
